# Week Five

## Sound

- Audacity

  - Had to download Audacity for mac via fosshub.com

  - I have used this program before for previous classes soI knew my way around the application pretty well

  - Fairly simple user face


- TwoTone

   - The application is pretty user friendly and well designed for first time users
   
   - The archaeological data that was provided was put to use and a sonification was created, very interesting sounds created with different sets of data!
   
   - I played around with the different options such as the instrument, key, filter by, data source and octave to create different combinations and different sonifications.

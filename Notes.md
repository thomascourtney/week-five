# Week Five

## Sound

- Audacity

  - Had to download Audacity for mac via fosshub.com

  - I have used this program before for previous classes soI knew my way around the application pretty well

  - Fairly simple user face


- TwoTone

   - The application is pretty user friendly and well designed for first time users
   
   - The archaeological data that was provided was put to use and a sonification was created, very interesting sounds created with different sets of data!
   
   - I played around with the different options such as the instrument, key, filter by, data source and octave to create different combinations and different sonifications.
   

## Mapping

- Story Map

  - My map of the recent travels I have been on

## Posters

- When mentioning colour theory and typography to influence psychology, it was interesting to learn about much of what you take in to do with colour or font has to do with familiarities and not so much 'psychology'

- Inkscape

  - Very similar to other photoshop editor programs
  - We can split up the image by selecting 'object', 'ungroup', then 'group' to return back to the original
